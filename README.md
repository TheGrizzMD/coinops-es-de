## **Configuration Options**

- The theme has a simple set of options that can be changed directly from the UI Settings menu of ES-DE 
- `Theme Variant` - sets the layout used for the sytem gamelist views.  There are 3 variants to choose from:
   - `Default` - Default view that displays system and gamelist metadata for each view
   - `No Hue` - The same as the Default view, but no blue/purple hue is applied to the system and fan art overlays
   - `Simple` - A minimalistic view with no metadata in the system or gamelist views
   - `Simple With Cover Art` - A minimalistic view with no metadata in the system or gamelist views (with cover art)
- `Theme Aspect Ratio` - sets the aspect ratio the theme will render at. If needed, this can be changed to match the aspect ratio of your screen (though it should happen automatically).
   - Supported Aspect Ratios:
      - 16:9
      - 16:10
      - 4:3
      - 19.5:9

## **Additional Notes**

### Scraping:

* This theme looks best when the following are set to be scraped under Scraper > Content Settings:
   * Game Names
   * Ratings
   * Other Metadata
   * Videos
   * Box Cover Images
   * Marquee (Wheel) Images
   * Fan Art Images
* Other media is optional and will be used in cases where one of the above is missing (for example Screenshot images will be used if Videos are missing)

### Per game cabinet art:
* This theme supports using a unique cabinet or TV images for each game
* I have made a set of these images available via a theme addon here: https://github.com/TheGrizzMD/coinops-es-de-addons
